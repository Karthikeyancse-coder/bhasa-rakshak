# BHASA RAKSHAK

BHASA RAKSHAK is a cutting-edge, community-driven web platform designed to digitally preserve, document, and revitalize endangered Indian dialects and tribal languages facing extinction by 2050. This project aims to empower native speakers to record their dialects through multi-format uploads, transcribe audio content with AI-enabled subtitling, and build vibrant local communities around language preservation.

As linguistic diversity declines globally, BHASA RAKSHAK seeks to reclaim and celebrate cultural heritage by providing an accessible, inclusive platform combining modern technologies like AI-powered chat assistance, gamification, and social engagement tools. The system incentivizes contributions through points, badges, and leaderboards to foster sustained participation.

Beyond documentation, this platform functions as a digital archive and educational resource, hosting curated reading lists, interactive language games, and community forums where users can share stories and experiences. By bridging traditional knowledge with contemporary digital means, BHASA RAKSHAK supports grassroots revitalization efforts that sustain cultural identity and linguistic resilience across generations.

The project leverages a React frontend with sleek glassmorphism UI effects and a Firebase backend for secure authentication, real-time data handling, and scalable storage. BHASA RAKSHAK embodies a holistic approach to endangered language preservationâ€”uniting technology, culture, and community-driven action to prevent the irreversible loss of invaluable linguistic heritage.
